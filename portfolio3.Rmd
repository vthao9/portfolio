In this deliverable I would be doing some more visualizing of my findings from deliverable 2.
To do this we would need to load the previous information.
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library("tidyverse")
library("knitr")
purl("portfolio2.Rmd", output = "part2.r")
source("part1.r")
```
# Vizualizing

```{r}
ggplot(drugs, aes(x = Coke , y = Age)) + geom_point()
```
## OPERATIONALIZE
To operationalize my finding would involve in some sort of drug education.
